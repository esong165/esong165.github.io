### My Favorite Quote
As UCSD's CSE Department says:

>Start early and start often.

```java
public boolean success(boolean startEarly, boolean startOften){
  return (startEarly && startOften);
}
```

### Programming Experience
My *favorite* programming language is ~~Python~~ **Java**. `System.out.println("Hello, world!");`
